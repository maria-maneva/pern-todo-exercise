### Simple PERN Todo app - server and client

`npm install` - installs both server and client

`npm start` - starts both server and client

To setup the database, run the initial commands in /server/src/database.sql in terminal

To run separately:

`npm run start:server`

`npm run start:client`

Both using typescript. Client uses bootstrap for styling and context api for state management.
